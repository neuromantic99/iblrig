#  In this setting file, you will find a list of each device (i.e. hardware apparatus) you can control.
# Each device is named in the list below by the "device_" word beforehand, e.g. "device_frame2ttl".
# Each device has settings parameters, written below the device name, e.g. its COM port or code workflow to run it.
# To set these parameters, go to TODO DOCUMENTATION APPENDIX 3
